CMC APP for CS50

This is an app where I am learning how to work with a publicly available API key, in this case, CoinMarketCap.

A lot of time was frankly spent just understanding how the API works (in particular, trying not to download the entirety of the database).

Because there are limited API key runs per day with a basic account for CMC, I used sys.argv in order to allow the user to enter their own API key and coin they're interested in order to pull financial data for the coin they're interested in.
